\item \textbf{Block: OPTIONS}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{flow\_package\_name}---keyword to specify the name of the corresponding flow package.  If not specified, then the corresponding flow package must have the same name as this advanced transport package (the name associated with this package in the GWT name file).

\item \texttt{auxiliary}---defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable names.  There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that can be provided on this line; however, lists of information provided in subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary variable name defined here.   The number of auxiliary variables detected on this line determines the value for naux.  Comments cannot be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as auxiliary variable names.  Auxiliary variables may not be used by the package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the program.  The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary variables are specified on more than one line in the options block.

\item \texttt{flow\_package\_auxiliary\_name}---keyword to specify the name of an auxiliary variable in the corresponding flow package.  If specified, then the simulated concentrations from this advanced transport package will be copied into the auxiliary variable specified with this name.  Note that the flow package must have an auxiliary variable with this name or the program will terminate with an error.  If the flows for this advanced transport package are read from a file, then this option will have no affect.

\item \texttt{BOUNDNAMES}---keyword to indicate that boundary names may be provided with the list of well cells.

\item \texttt{PRINT\_INPUT}---keyword to indicate that the list of well information will be written to the listing file immediately after it is read.

\item \texttt{PRINT\_CONCENTRATION}---keyword to indicate that the list of well concentration will be printed to the listing file for every stress period in which ``HEAD PRINT'' is specified in Output Control.  If there is no Output Control option and PRINT\_CONCENTRATION is specified, then concentration are printed for the last time step of each stress period.

\item \texttt{PRINT\_FLOWS}---keyword to indicate that the list of well flow rates will be printed to the listing file for every stress period time step in which ``BUDGET PRINT'' is specified in Output Control.  If there is no Output Control option and ``PRINT\_FLOWS'' is specified, then flow rates are printed for the last time step of each stress period.

\item \texttt{SAVE\_FLOWS}---keyword to indicate that well flow terms will be written to the file specified with ``BUDGET FILEOUT'' in Output Control.

\item \texttt{CONCENTRATION}---keyword to specify that record corresponds to concentration.

\item \texttt{concfile}---name of the binary output file to write concentration information.

\item \texttt{BUDGET}---keyword to specify that record corresponds to the budget.

\item \texttt{FILEOUT}---keyword to specify that an output filename is expected next.

\item \texttt{budgetfile}---name of the binary output file to write budget information.

\item \texttt{TS6}---keyword to specify that record corresponds to a time-series file.

\item \texttt{FILEIN}---keyword to specify that an input filename is expected next.

\item \texttt{ts6\_filename}---defines a time-series file defining time series that can be used to assign time-varying values. See the ``Time-Variable Input'' section for instructions on using the time-series capability.

\item \texttt{OBS6}---keyword to specify that record corresponds to an observations file.

\item \texttt{obs6\_filename}---name of input file to define observations for the MWT package. See the ``Observation utility'' section for instructions for preparing observation input files. Tables \ref{table:gwf-obstypetable} and \ref{table:gwt-obstypetable} lists observation type(s) supported by the MWT package.

\end{description}
\item \textbf{Block: PACKAGEDATA}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{mawno}---integer value that defines the well number associated with the specified PACKAGEDATA data on the line. MAWNO must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NMAWWELLS. Well information must be specified for every well or the program will terminate with an error.  The program will also terminate with an error if information for a well is specified more than once.

\item \texttt{strt}---real value that defines the starting concentration for the well.

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{aux}---represents the values of the auxiliary variables for each well. The values of auxiliary variables must be present for each well. The values must be specified in the order of the auxiliary variables specified in the OPTIONS block.  If the package supports time series and the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.}

\item \texttt{boundname}---name of the well cell.  BOUNDNAME is an ASCII character variable that can contain as many as 40 characters.  If BOUNDNAME contains spaces in it, then the entire name must be enclosed within single quotes.

\end{description}
\item \textbf{Block: PERIOD}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{iper}---integer value specifying the starting stress period number for which the data specified in the PERIOD block apply.  IPER must be less than or equal to NPER in the TDIS Package and greater than zero.  The IPER value assigned to a stress period block must be greater than the IPER value assigned for the previous PERIOD block.  The information specified in the PERIOD block will continue to apply for all subsequent stress periods, unless the program encounters another PERIOD block.

\item \texttt{mawno}---integer value that defines the well number associated with the specified PERIOD data on the line. MAWNO must be greater than zero and less than or equal to NMAWWELLS.

\item \texttt{mwtsetting}---line of information that is parsed into a keyword and values.  Keyword values that can be used to start the MWTSETTING string include: STATUS, CONCENTRATION, RAINFALL, EVAPORATION, RUNOFF, and AUXILIARY.  These settings are used to assign the concentration of associated with the corresponding flow terms.  Concentrations cannot be specified for all flow terms.  For example, the Multi-Aquifer Well Package supports a ``WITHDRAWAL'' flow term.  If this withdrawal term is active, then water will be withdrawn from the well at the calculated concentration of the well.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=blockdefinition]
STATUS <status>
CONCENTRATION <@concentration@>
RATE <@rate@>
AUXILIARY <auxname> <@auxval@> 
\end{lstlisting}

\item \texttt{status}---keyword option to define well status.  STATUS can be ACTIVE, INACTIVE, or CONSTANT. By default, STATUS is ACTIVE, which means that concentration will be calculated for the well.  If a well is inactive, then there will be no solute mass fluxes into or out of the well and the inactive value will be written for the well concentration.  If a well is constant, then the concentration for the well will be fixed at the user specified value.

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{concentration}---real or character value that defines the concentration for the well. The specified CONCENTRATION is only applied if the well is a constant concentration well. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.}

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{rate}---real or character value that defines the injection solute concentration $(ML^{-3})$ for the well. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.}

\item \texttt{AUXILIARY}---keyword for specifying auxiliary variable.

\item \texttt{auxname}---name for the auxiliary variable to be assigned AUXVAL.  AUXNAME must match one of the auxiliary variable names defined in the OPTIONS block. If AUXNAME does not match one of the auxiliary variable names defined in the OPTIONS block the data are ignored.

\item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{auxval}---value for the auxiliary variable. If the Options block includes a TIMESERIESFILE entry (see the ``Time-Variable Input'' section), values can be obtained from a time series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value.}
