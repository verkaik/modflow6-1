\item \texttt{HEAD\_BASED}---keyword to indicate the head-based formulation will be used to simulate coarse-grained aquifer materials and no-delay and delay interbeds. Specifying HEAD\_BASED also specifies the INITIAL\_PRECONSOLIDATION\_HEAD option.

\item \texttt{INITIAL\_PRECONSOLIDATION\_HEAD}---keyword to indicate that preconsolidation heads will be specified for no-delay and delay interbeds in the PACKAGEDATA block. If the SPECIFIED\_INITIAL\_INTERBED\_STATE option is specified in the OPTIONS block, user-specified preconsolidation heads in the PACKAGEDATA block are absolute values. Otherwise, user-specified preconsolidation heads in the PACKAGEDATA block are relative to steady-state or initial heads.

\item \texttt{COMPRESSION\_INDICES}---keyword to indicate that the recompression (CR) and compression (CC) indices are specified instead of the elastic specific storage (SSE) and inelastic specific storage (SSV) coefficients. If not specified, then elastic specific storage (SSE) and inelastic specific storage (SSV) coefficients must be specified.

\item \texttt{UPDATE\_MATERIAL\_PROPERTIES}---keyword to indicate that the thickness and void ratio of coarse-grained and interbed sediments (delay and no-delay) will vary during the simulation.
