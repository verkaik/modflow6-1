\item \textbf{Block: OPTIONS}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{SAVE\_FLOWS}---keyword to indicate that IST flow terms will be written to the file specified with ``BUDGET FILEOUT'' in Output Control.

\item \texttt{SORPTION}---is a text keyword to indicate that sorption will be activated.  Use of this keyword requires that BULK\_DENSITY and DISTCOEF are specified in the GRIDDATA block.  The linear sorption isotherm is the only isotherm presently supported in the IST Package.

\item \texttt{FIRST\_ORDER\_DECAY}---is a text keyword to indicate that first-order decay will occur.  Use of this keyword requires that DECAY and DECAY\_SORBED (if sorbtion is active) are specified in the GRIDDATA block.

\item \texttt{ZERO\_ORDER\_DECAY}---is a text keyword to indicate that zero-order decay will occur.  Use of this keyword requires that DECAY and DECAY\_SORBED (if sorbtion is active) are specified in the GRIDDATA block.

\item \texttt{CIM}---keyword to specify that record corresponds to immobile concentration.

\item \texttt{FILEOUT}---keyword to specify that an output filename is expected next.

\item \texttt{cimfile}---name of the output file to write immobile concentrations.  This file is a binary file that has the same format and structure as a binary head and concentration file.  The value for the text variable written to the file is CIM.  Immobile domain concentrations will be written to this file at the same interval as mobile domain concentrations are saved, as specified in the GWT Model Output Control file.

\item \texttt{PRINT\_FORMAT}---keyword to specify format for printing to the listing file.

\item \texttt{columns}---number of columns for writing data.

\item \texttt{width}---width for writing each number.

\item \texttt{digits}---number of digits to use for writing a number.

\item \texttt{format}---write format can be EXPONENTIAL, FIXED, GENERAL, or SCIENTIFIC.

\item \textbf{Block: GRIDDATA}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{cim}---initial concentration of the immobile domain in mass per length cubed.  If CIM is not specified, then it is assumed to be zero.

\item \texttt{thetaim}---porosity of the immobile domain specified as the volume of immobile pore space per total volume (dimensionless).

\item \texttt{zetaim}---mass transfer rate coefficient between the mobile and immobile domains, in dimensions of per time.

\item \texttt{decay}---is the rate coefficient for first or zero-order decay for the aqueous phase of the immobile domain.  A negative value indicates solute production.  The dimensions of decay for first-order decay is one over time.  The dimensions of decay for zero-order decay is mass per length cubed per time.  decay will have no affect on simulation results unless either first- or zero-order decay is specified in the options block.

\item \texttt{decay\_sorbed}---is the rate coefficient for first or zero-order decay for the sorbed phase of the immobile domain.  A negative value indicates solute production.  The dimensions of decay\_sorbed for first-order decay is one over time.  The dimensions of decay\_sorbed for zero-order decay is mass of solute per mass of aquifer per time.  If decay\_sorbed is not specified and both decay and sorbtion are active, then the program will terminate with an error.  decay\_sorbed will have no affect on simulation results unless the SORPTION keyword and either first- or zero-order decay are specified in the options block.

\item \texttt{bulk\_density}---is the bulk density of the aquifer in mass per length cubed.  bulk\_density will have no affect on simulation results unless the SORBTION keyword is specified in the options block.

\item \texttt{distcoef}---is the distribution coefficient for the equilibrium-controlled linear sorption isotherm in dimensions of length cubed per mass.  distcoef will have no affect on simulation results unless the SORBTION keyword is specified in the options block.
