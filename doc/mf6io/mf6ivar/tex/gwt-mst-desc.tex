\item \textbf{Block: OPTIONS}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{SAVE\_FLOWS}---keyword to indicate that MST flow terms will be written to the file specified with ``BUDGET FILEOUT'' in Output Control.

\item \texttt{FIRST\_ORDER\_DECAY}---is a text keyword to indicate that first-order decay will occur.  Use of this keyword requires that DECAY and DECAY\_SORBED (if sorbtion is active) are specified in the GRIDDATA block.

\item \texttt{ZERO\_ORDER\_DECAY}---is a text keyword to indicate that zero-order decay will occur.  Use of this keyword requires that DECAY and DECAY\_SORBED (if sorbtion is active) are specified in the GRIDDATA block.

\item \texttt{sorption}---is a text keyword to indicate that sorption will be activated.  Valid sorption options include LINEAR, FREUNDLICH, and LANGMUIR.  Use of this keyword requires that BULK\_DENSITY and DISTCOEF are specified in the GRIDDATA block.  If sorption is specified as FREUNDLICH or LANGMUIR then SP2 is also required in the GRIDDATA block.

\item \textbf{Block: GRIDDATA}

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{porosity}---is the aquifer porosity.

\item \texttt{decay}---is the rate coefficient for first or zero-order decay for the aqueous phase of the mobile domain.  A negative value indicates solute production.  The dimensions of decay for first-order decay is one over time.  The dimensions of decay for zero-order decay is mass per length cubed per time.  decay will have no affect on simulation results unless either first- or zero-order decay is specified in the options block.

\item \texttt{decay\_sorbed}---is the rate coefficient for first or zero-order decay for the sorbed phase of the mobile domain.  A negative value indicates solute production.  The dimensions of decay\_sorbed for first-order decay is one over time.  The dimensions of decay\_sorbed for zero-order decay is mass of solute per mass of aquifer per time.  If decay\_sorbed is not specified and both decay and sorbtion are active, then the program will terminate with an error.  decay\_sorbed will have no affect on simulation results unless the SORPTION keyword and either first- or zero-order decay are specified in the options block.

\item \texttt{bulk\_density}---is the bulk density of the aquifer in mass per length cubed.  bulk\_density is not required unless the SORBTION keyword is specified.

\item \texttt{distcoef}---is the distribution coefficient for the equilibrium-controlled linear sorption isotherm in dimensions of length cubed per mass.  distcoef is not required unless the SORPTION keyword is specified.

\item \texttt{sp2}---is the exponent for the Freundlich isotherm and the sorption capacity for the Langmuir isotherm.
