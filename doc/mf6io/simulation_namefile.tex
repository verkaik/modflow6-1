The simulation name file contains information about simulation options, simulation timing, models that are present in the simulation, how models exchange information, and how models are solved.

The present version of \mf uses the concept of a solution group.  For most simulations, a solution group will contain one solution and one model within that solution.  The solution group is designed, however, so that multiple solutions can be solved together in a picard iteration loop.  This might be used in the future to iteratively couple models that cannot be tightly coupled at the matrix level within a single numerical solution.  The solution group is flexible so that multiple solution groups can be included in a simulation.  More information on solution groups will be added to this document as new model types and exchanges are added that can take advantage of the concept.

The simulation name file is read from a file in the current working directory with the name ``mfsim.nam''.  Input within the simulation name file is provided through the following input blocks, which must be listed in the order shown below.  The options block itself is optional.  All other blocks are required.
