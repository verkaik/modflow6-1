Observations are available for GWF models, GWF-GWF exchanges, and all stress packages. Available observation types have been listed for each package that supports observations (tables~\ref{table:gwfobstype} to~\ref{table:gwf-gwfobstype}). All available observation types are repeated in Table~\ref{table:gwf-obstypetable} for convenience. 

The sign convention adopted for flow observations are identical to the conventions used in budgets contained in listing files and used in the cell-by-cell budget output. For flow-ja-face observation types, negative and positive values represent a loss from and gain to the cellid specified for ID, respectively. For standard stress packages (Package = CHD, DRN, EVT, GHB, RCH, RIV, and WEL), negative and positive values represent a loss from and gain to the GWF model, respectively. For advanced packages (Package = LAK, MAW, SFR, and UZF), negative and positive values for exchanges with the GWF model (Observation type = lak, maw, sfr, uzf-gwrch, uzf-gwd, uzf-gwd-to-mvr, and uzf-gwet) represent a loss from and gain to the GWF model, respectively. For other advanced stress package flow terms, negative and positive values represent a loss from and gain from the advanced package, respectively.
