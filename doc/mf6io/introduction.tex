\mf is a command line executable program that reads input from ASCII text files, and optionally from binary files.  \mf writes simulation output to ASCII text and binary files.  \mf itself, like its predecessors, does not provide any graphical output, though users may decide to adopt a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for preparing model input and visualizing model output.  This document provides details on the format of the input files and the format of the output files.  Details on the numerical methods and the underlying theory for MODFLOW 6 are described in separate reports \citep{modflow6framework, modflow6gwf, modflow6xt3d, langevin2020hydraulic}.  Instructions for preparing the input or visualizing the output is beyond the scope of this report.
