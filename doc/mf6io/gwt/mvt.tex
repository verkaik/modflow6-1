Mover Transport (MVT) Package information is read from the file that is specified by ``MVT6'' as the file type.  Only one MVT Package can be specified for a GWT model.  

The MVT Package is used to route solute mass according to flows from the GWF Water Mover (MVR) Package.  This MVT Package must be activated by the user if the MVR Package was active for the GWF Model.  Flows from the GWF MVR Package must be available to the GWT model either through activation of a GWF-GWT Exchange or through specification of ``GWFMOVER'' in the PACKAGEDATA block of the GWT FMI Package.
